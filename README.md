## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ JavaScript Basics
- **Task 1:** Display an alert: `alert("Hello, World!");`
- **Task 2:** Demonstrate different data types (string, number, boolean).
- **Task 3:** Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
- **Task 4:** Concatenate strings.
- **Task 5:** Log types of variables using `typeof`.

### 2️⃣ Code Structure

### 3️⃣ Modern JavaScript: "Strict Mode" and Variables
- **Task 11-15:** Use "use strict" and demonstrate its effects.
- **Task 16-20:** Use `let`, `const`, and `var`. Highlight their scoping and differences.

### 4️⃣ Data Types and Operators
- **Task 21-25:** Work with data types, including symbols and null.
- **Task 26-30:** Perform implicit and explicit type conversion.
- **Task 31-35:** Use comparison operators (e.g., `===`, `!==`).
